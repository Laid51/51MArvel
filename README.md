Small Web app made with Angular 


The goal of this project was to take control of Angular through a small application in which it was necessary to extract information from API calls.
Although this small project was carried out as a group, I had the opportunity to strongly influence it, particularly on the backend of the application and the management of API calls. The API we chose is a public JSON API provided by Marvel. 

Our application consists of retrieving a list of Marvel characters, series and comics and presenting them to users. The latter can search for a particular character, series or comic by entering its name or title in a search bar and also display the details concerning them. It is also possible to search for characters based on the first letter of their name.

Carrying out this project was very instructive and demanding, particularly in handling an API in a web application.
